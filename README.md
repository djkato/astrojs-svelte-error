# ERROR DETAILS

-   I run `bun i && bun dev`, visit `http://localhost:4321/err1` and `http://localhost:4321/err2` to see errors
-   This issue appears in many places, and is hard to know what's broken when the stack trace place points to arbitrary places.
-   I stripped all css and unnecessary stuff, this should be minimal enough?
-   My env:
    -   OS: EndeavourOS Linux x86_64
    -   Bun: 1.1.32
    -   Node: v23.1.0

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
